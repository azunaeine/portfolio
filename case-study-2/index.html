      Inflation has sharply increased over the years. Covid, the Ukrainian war and the shortage of goods has put pressure on consumers. As a result of this, the prices of goods have become unaffordable for people. Upowallet aims to help people budget and find unique ways to save money by ensuring that their financial goals are met.

      <p class="describe">
        Inflation has caused a lot of financial stress and has impacted the way people spend money. In this world, there are not many options and resources to help educate people to find creative ways to save money. In recent news, there were reports that in the country of Canada, the inflation rate has sharply increased to 8.1%. This is a troubling problem for many Canadians as it shows that the world has sharply changed economically. Presently, there are very few budgeting apps and resources that help people become more financially responsible.

      <p class="interview">
        To get a better understanding of  people’s spending patterns and the ways they save  money, I conducted 2 user interviews. These interviews were primarily focused on students and working adults as they were the two groups that were primarily concerned with how much they spent money and budgeted it. When interviewing this two groups, we wanted to assess three questions: 


      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          How much do you spend daily or weekly?

        </li>
        <li>
          How much money do you save per day or per week?

        </li>
        <li>
          Do you use budgeting apps or any resources to help you save money? 

        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="persona">
      <h3 class="persona">Persona</h3>
      <p class="persona-info">
        Since working adults were most likely to  spend more money than students. I used the results from the interviews I conducted and created one persona reflecting a working adult. This helped to guide my design process.

      <h3 class="insights">Insights</h3>
      <p class="info-one">
        The participants in the interview gave me mixed responses. Most of the students in the interview claimed that their tight budget and the high-cost of attending post-secondary institutions was the reason  they rarely spent their money. They claimed that they preferred to spend money on  things that were absolutely necessary like food.  The students in the interview also claimed that they rarely used budgeting apps as they felt it wasn’t necessary based on their low cost of living.  On the other hand, working adults spent more money because of their bills and expenses. In addition, working adults claimed they relied on  budgeting  websites and mobile applications to help them find creative ways to spend money. I acquired feedback and insights about the most desirable features they would like on the budgeting app:
