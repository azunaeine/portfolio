        In order to understand people's online dating experience in a better
        perspective and to find ways to improve their dating experience
        virtually, me and my partner conducted multiple user interviews that
        involved people who were in a long-term relationship. Our primary aim
        for interviewing came when analyzing and assessing three questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          How did they display intimacy when on dating apps?
        </li>
        <li>
          How often did they use dating apps?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why do they use dating apps?

      <h3 class="insights">Insights</h3>
      <p class="info-one">
        The participants in the interviews gave us shocking responses. Some of
        the participants in the interviews stated that there weren't any AI
        dating apps available or any dating apps that helped them go on virtual
        dates. In addition, they claimed that most mobile applications lacked
        the technology to include virtual dates in their
        platform. Furthermore, the participants also said that many dating apps
        lacked features that would help them be intimate with their matches virtually. Me
        and my partner acquired feedback and insights about the most desirable
        features they would like to have in an AI dating app:

        Me and my partner kept thinking of ways to connect the users experience
        and the app’s value. We continued to ponder and think and we began to
        analyze the data. We came up with a venn diagram to connect our ideas.

             <br> <span class="bold">Confidence:</span> I also learned that I must be confident when designing. Never look down on yourself.
